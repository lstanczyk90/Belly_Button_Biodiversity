# Belly Button Biodiversity

The purpose of this website is to provide an interactive visualization to participants of our belly button bacteria study. Using a combination of JS, HTML, and CSS, we have published the data that we have obtained as part of the study. All user names remain anonymous, and any interested participant may access his or her results by simply selecting his or her User ID from the dropdown.
